# Campaigns

Manage your campaigns, from a message, to recipients and finish with statuses.

First of all, you'll need a validated [sending domain](../domains/index.md).

You can start by creating some [categories](categories.md#create-a-category), then build your very first [message](messages.md#create-a-message).

Maybe youâ€™ll add some [attachments](attachments.md#add-an-attachment). Add at least one [recipient](recipients.md#create-a-recipient).
