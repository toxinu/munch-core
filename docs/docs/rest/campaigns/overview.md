# Campaigns

Manage your campaigns, from a message, to recipients and finish with statuses.

You can start by creating some [categories](/campaigns/categories#create-a-category), then build your very first [message](/campaigns/messages#create-a-message).

Maybe youâ€™ll add some [attachments](/campaigns/message-attachments#create-an-attachment). Add at least one [recipient](/campaigns/recipients#create-a-recipient).
